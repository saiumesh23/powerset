# powerset
this power set is useful for finding substrings in a given string
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substring
HOW THIS WORKS:
     this is actually done by bit manpulation.Total number of substring equals to 2^n-1 which can also be written as (1<<n)-1.
     we will itertae upto that value.and do some bit manpluation stuff.
